<p><b>My name is Prashanta Shrestha; I was born in Nepal on January 25, 2009.  My mother is Devi Shrestha, and my father is Meghendra Shrestha.  Neither my father nor my mother named; it was my aunt who did.  I was born 12 minutes after my brother, Prajwal Shrestha.  When i was six months old, my family moved into America.  An old couple taking living in Artesia of the county of LA took care of me and my brother when my mother and father left for work.  We used to cause a lot of trouble, like pushing the pillows out of the balcony and crawling to the road, full of moving cars.
Today, I'm 14 years old, with a love for soccer and a freshman in Cerritos High School.</b></p>
